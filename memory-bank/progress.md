## Known Issues

### P2P Networking
- ⚠️ Occasional connection drops in unstable networks
- ⚠️ Limited scalability beyond ~20 concurrent peers
- ⚠️ No automatic reconnection after network interruptions

### LLM Integration
- ⚠️ Dependency on Ollama being installed and running
- ⚠️ Limited error handling for Ollama API failures
- ⚠️ No fallback when requested model is unavailable

### User Interface
- ⚠️ Fixed window dimensions with limited responsiveness
- ⚠️ No dark/light theme toggle
- ⚠️ Limited accessibility features

## Current Status
SeekDeep is currently in a functional state with all core features implemented. The application successfully enables P2P collaboration with local LLMs through Ollama. Users can create or join sessions, select models, and interact with the LLM in both collaborative and private modes.

The focus is now on improving testing coverage, optimizing performance, and addressing known issues before considering additional feature enhancements.

## Next Milestones
1. Complete test suite implementation
2. Address critical known issues
3. Optimize performance for larger peer groups
4. Consider persistence mechanisms for chat history
5. Explore authentication options for more secure sessions
