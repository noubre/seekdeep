# Product Context: SeekDeep

## Problem Statement
Users of local LLMs often face challenges in collaborating and sharing insights. Traditional LLM interfaces lack P2P capabilities, making it difficult for teams to work together with AI assistance. Additionally, local LLM deployments typically don't support real-time collaboration or sharing of model capabilities across different machines.

## Solution
SeekDeep provides a specialized desktop application that combines local LLM capabilities with P2P networking. It enables users to:
- Connect directly with peers without central servers
- Share access to local LLM models with peers who may not have them installed
- Collaborate in real-time with shared or private chat modes
- View rich, formatted responses with markdown rendering
- See the LLM's "thinking" process when available

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Clean, minimalist UI that focuses on the conversation
- **Flexibility**: Support for both collaborative and private chat modes
- **Transparency**: Visibility into the LLM's thinking process
- **Richness**: Proper rendering of markdown for formatted responses
- **Responsiveness**: Real-time streaming of LLM responses
- **Connectivity**: Seamless P2P connections without complex configuration

## Key Features
1. **P2P Networking**: Decentralized connections via Hyperswarm
2. **LLM Integration**: Direct interface with Ollama for local LLM access
3. **Dual Chat Modes**: 
   - Collaborative mode where all peers see all messages
   - Private mode where each peer has a separate conversation
4. **Model Sharing**: Host shares available models with connected peers
5. **Markdown Rendering**: Rich formatting of LLM responses
6. **Thinking Content Display**: Visibility into the LLM's reasoning process
7. **Response Streaming**: Real-time display of LLM responses as they're generated

## User Workflows
1. **Host Session**: User starts a new session and shares the topic key with peers
2. **Join Session**: Peers join an existing session using the topic key
3. **Model Selection**: Users select from available models (local or from host)
4. **Chat Mode Selection**: Host toggles between collaborative and private modes
5. **Query Submission**: Users submit prompts to the LLM
6. **Response Viewing**: Users see formatted responses with thinking content

## Value Proposition
SeekDeep transforms how teams interact with local LLMs by making the experience collaborative, transparent, and flexible. It bridges the gap between powerful local LLM deployments and the need for team collaboration, without sacrificing privacy or requiring cloud services.
