# Project Brief: SeekDeep

## Overview
SeekDeep is a P2P-enabled desktop application that interfaces with local Large Language Models (LLMs) through Ollama. It provides a clean, minimalist UI for interacting with LLMs while enabling peer-to-peer collaboration through Hyperswarm and Hypercore technologies.

## Core Requirements
1. Interface with local LLMs via Ollama API
2. Enable P2P networking for decentralized connections
3. Support both collaborative and private chat modes
4. Provide streaming responses from LLMs
5. Render markdown content for rich, formatted responses
6. Display "thinking" content from LLMs that expose it
7. Support multiple concurrent peers

## Goals
- Create a responsive desktop application using Pear Runtime
- Implement efficient P2P communication protocols
- Provide a clean, intuitive user interface
- Support flexible peer interactions through different chat modes
- Enable model sharing between peers
- Maintain consistent experience across all connected peers

## Target Users
- Developers and researchers working with LLMs
- Teams needing collaborative AI assistance
- Users who prefer local LLM deployment for privacy or performance
- Knowledge workers who need to share AI insights

## Success Metrics
- Seamless P2P connectivity
- Consistent user experience across peers
- Reliable message delivery and response streaming
- Proper handling of different chat modes
- Effective model sharing between peers
- Clean rendering of markdown and "thinking" content
