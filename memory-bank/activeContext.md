# Active Context: SeekDeep

## Current Focus
The SeekDeep project is a P2P-enabled desktop application that interfaces with local LLMs through Ollama. The application allows users to collaborate in real-time, sharing access to LLM capabilities across a peer-to-peer network. The core functionality is now implemented with a focus on improving testing coverage, optimizing performance, and addressing known issues.

## Key Components

### Desktop Application (app.js)
- Provides the main user interface for interacting with LLMs
- Handles P2P networking through Hyperswarm
- Manages different chat modes (collaborative vs. private)
- Implements model sharing between peers
- Processes LLM queries and streams responses in real-time
- Handles peer message routing based on chat mode

### Server Component (server.js)
- Optional standalone server for headless environments
- Proxies requests to Ollama API
- Enables P2P access to a remote Ollama instance
- Useful for machines where the desktop app can't be run directly

### User Interface (index.html)
- Clean, minimalist chat interface with Nord-inspired color palette
- Support for markdown rendering with proper formatting
- Display of "thinking" content from LLMs in special containers
- Model selection dropdown with refresh capability
- Chat mode controls (host only)
- Active users display with color-coding for easy identification

## Current Implementation

### Architecture Implementation
1. **Hybrid Client-Server and P2P**: Successfully implemented both standalone desktop app and P2P networking capabilities
2. **Host-Peer Model**: Clear distinction between host (initiates session) and peers (join session) with appropriate permissions
3. **Centralized Mode Control**: Only the host can change chat modes, with validation to prevent unauthorized changes
4. **Model Sharing**: Host automatically shares available models with peers during handshake and on-demand via refresh

### Technical Implementation
1. **Vanilla JavaScript**: Using standard JavaScript without frameworks for simplicity and direct DOM manipulation
2. **Pear Runtime**: Successfully integrated with Pear for cross-platform desktop capabilities
3. **Hyperswarm/Hypercore**: Implemented P2P networking with topic-based discovery and secure connections
4. **Ollama Integration**: Direct integration with Ollama API for LLM access, with support for multiple models

### UX Implementation
1. **Dual Chat Modes**: Both collaborative (shared chat) and private (separate chats) modes fully implemented
2. **Markdown Rendering**: Rich formatting for LLM responses with proper handling of code blocks, lists, tables, etc.
3. **Thinking Content Display**: Special formatting for LLM "thinking" content with distinct visual styling
4. **Streaming Responses**: Real-time display of LLM outputs with token-by-token updates

## Active Considerations

### Current Challenges
1. **P2P Scalability**: Performance testing needed for larger peer groups (beyond 20 concurrent peers)
2. **Network Reliability**: Occasional connection drops in unstable networks need more robust handling
3. **Error Recovery**: Improved recovery mechanisms needed for network interruptions and API failures
4. **UI Responsiveness**: Optimizing rendering performance for long chat sessions with many messages

### Open Questions
1. **Persistence**: Implementing optional chat history persistence between sessions
2. **Authentication**: Adding peer authentication for more secure sessions
3. **Offline Support**: Developing fallback mechanisms when Ollama is unavailable
4. **Mobile Support**: Evaluating feasibility of extending to mobile platforms

## Recent Changes
- Enhanced message protocol with improved validation for mode updates
- Optimized streaming response handling for better performance
- Improved error handling for network and API failures
- Updated documentation with detailed message protocol examples
- Added visual indicators for peer attribution in messages
- Implemented proper handling of thinking content in streamed responses

## Next Steps
1. Complete test suite implementation for core functionality
2. Address critical known issues, particularly around connection stability
3. Optimize performance for larger peer groups
4. Implement basic persistence mechanisms for chat history
5. Explore authentication options for more secure sessions
6. Enhance error recovery for network interruptions
